IDL.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>rmic [ <A href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/rmic.html#options">options</A> ] <I>package-qualified-class-name(s)</I>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The <B>rmic</B> compiler generates stub and skeleton class files (JRMP 
  protocol) and stub and tie class files (IIOP protocol) for remote objects. 
  These classes files are generated from compiled Java programming language 
  classes that are remote object implementation classes. A remote implementation 
  class is a class that implements the interface <TT>java.rmi.Remote</TT>. The 
  class names in the <B>rmic</B> command must be for classes that have been 
  compiled successfully with the <B>javac</B> command and must be fully package 
  qualified. For example, running <B>rmic</B> on the class file name 
  <TT>HelloImpl</TT> as shown here:</P><PRE>rmic hello.HelloImpl
</PRE>
  <P>creates the <TT>HelloImpl_Stub.class</TT> file in the <TT>hello</TT> 
  subdirectory (named for the class's package).</P>
  <P>A <I>skeleton</I> for a remote object is a JRMP protocol server-side entity 
  that has a method that dispatches calls to the actual remote object 
  implementation.</P>
  <P>A <I>tie</I> for a remote object is a server-side entity similar to a 
  skeleton, but which communicates with the client using the IIOP protocol.</P>
  <P>A <I>stub</I> is a client-side proxy for a remote object which is 
  responsible for communicating method invocations on remote objects to the 
  server where the actual remote object implementation resides. A client's 
  reference to a remote object, therefore, is actually a reference to a local 
  stub.</P>
  <P>By default, <B>rmic</B> generates stub classes that use the 1.2 JRMP stub 
  protocol version only, as if the <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/rmic.html#v1.2"><TT>-v1.2</TT> 
  option</A> had been specified. (Note that the <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/rmic.html#vcompat"><TT>-vcompat</TT> 
  option</A> was the default in releases prior to 5.0.) Use the <A 
  href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/rmic.html#iiop"><CODE>-iiop</CODE> 
  option</A> to generate stub and tie classes for the IIOP protocol.</P>
  <P>A stub implements only the remote interfaces, not any local interfaces that 
  the remote object also implements. Because a JRMP stub implements the same set 
  of remote interfaces as the remote object itself, a client can use the Java 
  programming language's built-in operators for casting and type checking. For 
  IIOP, the <TT>PortableRemoteObject.narrow</TT> method must be 
used.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A name=options>OPTIONS</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <DL>
    <DT><B>-bootclasspath path</B> 
    <DD>Overrides location of bootstrap class files 
    <DT><B>-classpath path</B> 
    <DD>Specifies the path <B>rmic</B> uses to look up classes. This option 
    overrides the default or the CLASSPATH environment variable if it is set. 
    Directories are separated by colons. Thus the general format for <I>path</I> 
    is: 
    <DD>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>.:&lt;your_path&gt;
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>For example: 
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>.:/usr/local/java/classes
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <DT><B>-d directory</B> 
    <DD>Specifies the root destination directory for the generated class 
    hierarchy. You can use this option to specify a destination directory for 
    the stub, skeleton, and tie files. For example, the command 
    <DD>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>% rmic -d /java/classes foo.MyClass
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>would place the stub and skeleton classes derived from 
    <CODE>MyClass</CODE> into the directory <TT>/java/classes/foo</TT>. If the 
    <TT>-d</TT> option is not specified, the default behavior is as if 
    <TT>"-d&nbsp;."</TT> were specified: the package hierarchy of the target 
    class is created in the current directory, and stub/tie/skeleton files are 
    placed within it. (Note that in some previous versions of <B>rmic</B>, if 
    <TT>-d</TT> was not specified, then the package hierarchy was <I>not</I> 
    created, and all of the output files were placed directly in the current 
    directory.)<BR>&nbsp; 
    <DT><B>-extdirs path</B> 
    <DD>Overrides location of installed extensions 
    <DT><B>-g</B> 
    <DD>Enables generation of all debugging information, including local 
    variables. By default, only line number information is generated. 
    <DD>
    <P><A id=idl name=idl></A></P>
    <DT><B>-idl</B> 
    <DD>Causes <TT>rmic</TT> to generate OMG IDL for the classes specified and 
    any classes referenced. IDL provides a purely declarative, programming 
    language-independent way of specifying an object's API. The IDL is used as a 
    specification for methods and data that can be written in and invoked from 
    any language that provides CORBA bindings. This includes Java and C++ among 
    others. See the <A 
    href="http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/formal/java_language_mapping_to_omg_idl.htm">Java 
    Language to IDL Mapping</A> (OMG) document for a complete description. 
    <P>When the <CODE>-idl</CODE> option is used, other options also 
include:</P>
    <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><B>-always</B> or <B>-alwaysgenerate</B> 
      <DD>Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than 
      the input class. 
      <DT><B>-factory</B> 
      <DD>Uses factory keyword in generated IDL. 
      <DT><B>-idlModule&nbsp; fromJavaPackage[.class]&nbsp; toIDLModule</B> 
      <DD>Specifies IDLEntity package mapping. For example:&nbsp; <TT>-idlModule 
      foo.bar my::real::idlmod</TT>. 
      <DT><B>-idlFile&nbsp; fromJavaPackage[.class]&nbsp; toIDLFile</B> 
      <DD>Specifies IDLEntity file mapping. For example:&nbsp; <TT>-idlFile 
      test.pkg.X TEST16.idl</TT>.&nbsp; </DD></DL>
    <P><A id=iiop name=iiop></A></P>
    <DT><B>-iiop</B> 
    <DD>Causes <CODE>rmic</CODE> to generate IIOP stub and tie classes, rather 
    than JRMP stub and skeleton classes. A stub class is a local proxy for a 
    remote object and is used by clients to send calls to a server. Each remote 
    interface requires a stub class, which implements that remote interface. A 
    client's reference to a remote object is actually a reference to a stub. Tie 
    classes are used on the server side to process incoming calls, and dispatch 
    the calls to the proper implementation class. Each implementation class 
    requires a tie class. 
    <P>Invoking <TT>rmic</TT> with the <TT>-iiop</TT> generates stubs and ties 
    that conform to this naming convention:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>_&lt;implementationName&gt;_stub.class
<BR>
_&lt;interfaceName&gt;_tie.class
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>When the <CODE>-iiop</CODE> option is used, other options also 
    include:</P>
    <DD>
    <DL>
      <DT><B>-always</B> or <B>-alwaysgenerate</B> 
      <DD>Forces re-generation even when existing stubs/ties/IDL are newer than 
      the input class. 
      <DT><B>-nolocalstubs</B> 
      <DD>Do not create stubs optimized for same-process clients and servers. 
      <DT><B>-noValueMethods</B> 
      <DD>Must be used with the <CODE>-idl</CODE> option. Prevents addition of 
      <TT>valuetype</TT> methods and initializers to emitted IDL. These methods 
      and initializers are optional for <TT>valuetype</TT>s, and are generated 
      unless the <TT>-noValueMethods</TT> option is specified when using the 
      <TT>-idl</TT> option. 
      <DT><B>-poa</B> 
      <DD>Changes the inheritance from 
      <TT>org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.ObjectImpl</TT> to 
      <TT>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</TT>. 
      <P>The <TT>PortableServer</TT> module for the <A 
      href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/idl/POA.html">Portable 
      Object Adapter</A> (POA) defines the native <TT>Servant</TT> type. In the 
      Java programming language, the <TT>Servant</TT> type is mapped to the Java 
      <TT>org.omg.PortableServer.Servant</TT> class. It serves as the base class 
      for all POA servant implementations and provides a number of methods that 
      may be invoked by the application programmer, as well as methods which are 
      invoked by the POA itself and may be overridden by the user to control 
      aspects of servant behavior. Based on the OMG IDL to Java Language Mapping 
      Specification, CORBA V 2.3.1 ptc/00-01-08.pdf.</P></DD></DL>
    <DT><B>-J</B> 
    <DD>Used in conjunction with any <TT>java</TT> option, it passes the option 
    following the <TT>-J</TT> (no spaces between the -J and the option) on to 
    the <TT>java</TT> interpreter. 
    <DT><B>-keep</B> or <B>-keepgenerated</B> 
    <DD>Retains the generated <TT>.java</TT> source files for the stub, 
    skeleton, and/or tie classes and writes them to the same directory as the 
    <TT>.class</TT> files. 
    <DT><B>-nowarn</B> 
    <DD>Turns off warnings. If used the compiler does not print out any 
    warnings. 
    <DD>
    <P><A id=vcompat name=vcompat></A></P>
    <DT><B>-vcompat</B> 
    <DD>Generates stub and skeleton classes compatible with both the 1.1 and 1.2 
    JRMP stub protocol versions. (This option was the default in releases prior 
    to 5.0.) The generated stub classes will use the 1.1 stub protocol version 
    when loaded in a JDK 1.1 virtual machine and will use the 1.2 stub protocol 
    version when loaded into a 1.2 (or later) virtual machine. The generated 
    skeleton classes will support both 1.1 and 1.2 stub protocol versions. The 
    generated classes are relatively large in order to support both modes of 
    operation. 
    <DT><B>-verbose</B> 
    <DD>Causes the compiler and linker to print out messages about what classes 
    are being compiled and what class files are being loaded. 
    <DD>
    <P><A id=v1.1 name=v1.1></A></P>
    <DT><B>-v1.1</B> 
    <DD>Generates stub and skeleton classes for the 1.1 JRMP stub protocol 
    version only. Note that this option is only useful for generating stub 
    classes that are serialization-compatible with pre-existing, 
    statically-deployed stub classes that were generated by the <B>rmic</B> tool 
    from JDK 1.1 and that cannot be upgraded (and dynamic class loading is not 
    being used). 
    <DD>
    <P><A id=v1.2 name=v1.2></A></P>
    <DT><B>-v1.2</B> 
    <DD>(default) Generates stub classes for the 1.2 JRMP stub protocol version 
    only. No skeleton classes are generated with this option because skeleton 
    classes are not used with the 1.2 stub protocol version. The generated stub 
    classes will not work if they are loaded into a JDK 1.1 virtual machine.
