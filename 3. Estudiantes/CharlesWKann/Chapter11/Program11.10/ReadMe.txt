OVERVIEW

This program shows how to build an operator node from an operator class
using composition.  Note that either Program 11.8 or 11.9 can be used to
define the operator that is used.  Note also that a classification solution
to this problem does not exist because a single instance of each operator
was defined in Programs 11.8 and 11.9.  This saved space but meant that a 
classification solution was impossible since the number of objects could
not match.

TO COMPILE: javac OperatorNode.java

To RUN: java OperatorNode
