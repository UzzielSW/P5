To use the programs in this directory, you must first make sure that the
Animator Component developed in Chapter 7 is in your CLASSPATH environmental
variable.  If you are running using the J2SE or JDK from Sun on
a Windows box, and run the JDK from a DOS prompt, go to the
directory in which you installed the program from this book.  In that 
directory you will find a script named useAnimator.bat.  Run this
script once per dos shell, and the animator will be able to be used.

The animator package is stored in the directory "animator" which is a
subdirectory of the directory of where you stored the programs for this
book.  Thus to use this the animator package with an IDE or on Linux or
a variant of Unix, make sure the parent directory of the animation 
directory is in your CLASSPATH environment variable.

Note that the animator is not stored as a JAR file so that the source
code can be easily examined and recompiled.  All the programs in this book
were developed using JDK1.4.  You will have problems if you try to run them
with a version previous to this.
