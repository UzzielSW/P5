OVERVIEW

This program implements a simulation similar to the Gas Station from
Chapter 3.  However it is now implemented with the Java Event Model,
where the Pump is the Event Source, and with an Adapter, the PumpManager,
to handle controlling the PumpEvents from the Pump to the Cars.

TO COMPILE: javac GasStation.java

            Note:  Compiling ReadersWriters.java will compile
            Pump.java, Car.java, PumpEvent.java, PumpListener.java,
            and PumpManager.java.

To RUN: java GasStation
